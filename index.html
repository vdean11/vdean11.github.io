        <hr>
        <p>My name is Tori Dean, and I am still undecided about my major. I am from Talladega, AL, and I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Munford High School. <b style="color:red">ROAR LIONS!</b>
            My mom is a kindergarten teacher and my dad is a supervisor at an industrial plant and assistant high school wrestling coach.
            My sister is attending Jacksonville State University and majoring in nursing.
            While in high school, I was a part of a <a href="https://www.varsity.com/news/what-is-competitive-cheerleading/">competitive cheerleading</a> team
            and a member and secretary of the Student Government. I am a member of <a href="http://www.southsidetalladega.org/">Southside Baptist Church</a>, which I have attended since I was little.
            Here at <span style="color:blueviolet" >UNA</span>, I am a member of the <a href=https://www.una.edu/honors/index.html>Honors College</a> and have started going to the BCM. I also enjoy attending the different events on campus with my roommate.
        </p>
        <p>I enjoy reading and listening to music. My favorite books include <i>The Art of Racing in the Rain</i>, <i>The Hunger Games</i> trilogy, <i>If I Stay</i>,
            and <i>Two Summers</i>. The top three genres I listen to are country, classical, and worship. My favorite sports to watch are gymnastics, cheerleading, and football. 
            I also enjoy photography, although I'm not very good at it.
